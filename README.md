# Description
This is a game known as Flappy Bird where the bird jumps on tap and and you have to protect the bird from colliding with the pipes. A highscore is maintained so that you can see how high you have ever got.

This has been created using **XML**, **Java**, **LibGDX**.

## A. How to Play
When the game starts you have to start tapping on the screen to keep the bird from falling. You also have to ensure that the bird does not go beyond the reach of the screen.
You have to pass the bird from the space given between the pipes. Passing through each pipe gives a score of 1.

When you collide with the pipes or move out of the screen the game is over.
